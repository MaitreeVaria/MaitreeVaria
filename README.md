### Hi there, I'm Maitree VariaðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. I enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology and have a positive impact on society.

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new machine learning models and techniques and contributing to open-source projects related to AI and ML.

I'm always looking to learn more and expand my knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. If you share the same interests or have a project idea, feel free to reach out and connect on my email.
